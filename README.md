# space_elevator - The ActionCable Client for Ruby

space_elevator is a _client_ for integrating a ruby application with a remote ActionCable-based backend provided by Rails 5 or compatible framework. It allows for subscription and publication to multiple _channels_ simultaneously, and eavesdropping on wire-level messages. Harness the power of WebSockets to receive push notifications in your own Ruby applications!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'space_elevator'
```

And then execute:
